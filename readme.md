# Python Portfolio
> [!NOTE]
> These are the exercises I completed during my `Programming 1` course of the Data Science Career at the `National University of San Martin` (Buenos Aires, Argentina).
> You can see all the documentation here https://github.com/python-unsam/programacion1/tree/main/Notas
> In the link that I shared there are no exercises done by the university professors, the resolution of each exercise depended on each student. For each class there was a week to solve the exercises.
